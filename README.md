### An overall game of Rock Paper Scissor. 
As there are not much to said about my program as it has been challenging to work with GLTFLoader due to not allowing me to modify it outside of load function to the point of having to use OBJLoader since it at least offers way more support in terms of changing its properties at any time.

- Although the computer is the second player it selects its decision making is akin of spinning a wheel, changing its values (and in turn the models) in various amount of time until it stops which the computer has made its decision. In a shorter sentence you’ll win or lose purely through RNG’s.
